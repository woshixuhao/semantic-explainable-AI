# Some notes for using the cut_position function
The cut_position function is utilized to mask the semantic position manually. For each picture, we should click 4 times on the semantic position. You will see four red dots on the picture. Then, the picture will be closed and reopened automatically. You need to click 1 time on a nearby position (e.g., body) to decide the color of mask. When the operation is finished, the next picture will be opened. If the picture donnot has semantic position, you can click 4 time on the same place to skip this picture.
